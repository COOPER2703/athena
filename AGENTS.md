## Agent skills

### Issue tracker

Issues live in this repo's GitHub Issues, managed with the `gh` CLI. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels

Default vocabulary: `needs-triage`, `needs-info`, `ready-for-agent`, `ready-for-human`, `wontfix`. See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Domain docs

Single-context layout: `GLOSSARY.md` + `docs/adr/` at the repo root. See `docs/agents/domain.md`.

### Server logs

The server mirrors its trace stream to `logs/server.log` (same rendered lines as
`stderr`, filtered by `LOG_LEVEL`). The file rotates by size into
`server.log.1`…`server.log.3`. Override the directory with `ATHENA_LOG_DIR`.
Set `ATHENA_DEBUG_DECISIONS=1` to include `debug` entries. Read this file to
diagnose a past run without access to the server terminal.
